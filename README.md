Bobbitt, Zach. 2023. VBA: "How to Format Cells as Percentage". I used this website with help format my values into percentages on Step 75, 112, and 118 (https://www.statology.org/vba-percentage-format/)
Logan, Fred. 2024. I used his example he provided to me during our tutor session to make sure all my values are set as range (or cells if I rather use cells than ranges) on Step 75 specifically. He also assisted with providing the Max and Min function which was used from Step 110 to 124. This helped me in order to find out what the greatest increase and decrease percentage was and what the greatest total volume was.
